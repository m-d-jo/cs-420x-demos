A student who reviewed my work was drawn to the mouse interaction and color palette I used.  They really enjoyed carving paths through the canvas, then watching chemical B slowly dissipate back into the space.  The couple other points of critique they had were regarding stability; my site takes a long time to load/reset, and there are chances for the simulation to collapse on itself or reach a "broken" state (which is why I included a "Restart" button).  All of these factors fit my expectations well, and I'm glad that someone else found it pleasing to play with (despite technical issues)!
