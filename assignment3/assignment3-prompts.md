This is a fairly plain reaction diffusion simulation. Aside from coloring the two chemicals (A is a light green, and B is a dark blue), I made their diffusion rates depend on different factors: chemical A's diffusion rate increases toward the top and bottom edges of the canvas, while chemical B's diffusion rate increases gradually within a certain range of the canvas' center.

I also scaled up both reaction equations for pixels within a certain distance of the mouse cursor - in theory this should "accelerate" the reaction, but in practice this mostly seems to "burn off" chemical B, which closes the gap again once the cursor is gone.  Interestingly, the filled-in reaction lines follow the shape of the "burned" area quite well, so drawing a line across the canvas makes interesting straight patterns among random swirls.
