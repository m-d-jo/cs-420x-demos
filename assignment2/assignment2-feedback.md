Another student who reviewed my work enjoyed how I used cellular noise, fracturing the video feed.  He also liked that I used HSV sliders, since that system is not as commonly used as RGB controls.

They made an interesting suggestion, too: expanding the range of the HSV sliders.  I purposely limited the saturation and value sliders to avoid having *no* coloring - but I agree that being able to invert the colors with the same sliders would be very visually interesting.
